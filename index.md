## Description

Modern genomics technologies are able to produce large volumes of data that often leave researchers feeling overwhelmed and unsure of how to begin the process of biological interpretation.

In this course, we explain the common file formats generated by sequencing technologies and how they can be manipulated and explored by non bioinformaticians. The tools that we will use is the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) (http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/).

If time allows, there will be time at the end of the session for you to explore your own datasets with the assistance of the instructors.
